### The problem or what is needed for implementation
```
Create a product display page with the ability to add or remove from the cart
All data is called through an API link.
```

### Items used
```
I used the State & Props method.
```

### What I couldn't do due to lack of time
```
- The product images were supposed to be called from the "Dynamicimg" folder.
Inside the "src" folder, but there was a delay in displaying the data, so the solution was to move the images to the "public" file. If I had more time, I would search for a solution to this problem.
- Pay more attention to design, treat the media part, and display the design on different devices
```


### Explain what you did
```
- For products and items, I called them from their Api link
And I made a system that calls them 'class' so that if any other elements are added or the link is modified it can be easily modified
- I created an "Array" to add products in it as a shopping cart, then it was called to the display page of the purchase products
